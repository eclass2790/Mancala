Mancala
=======
This code can be ran from a termninal or command line.

This is one of many projects that I have done in C++ and there are more to come.


Mancala players begin by placing a certain number of seeds, prescribed for the particular game, in each of the pits on the game board

The Rules of the Game:

The Mancala 'board' is made up of two rows of six holes each. If you don't have a Mancala board handy, an empty egg carton is perfect.
Three pieces (marbles, stones or seeds) are placed in each of the 12 holes. The color of the pieces is irrelevant.
Each player has a 'store' to the right side of the Mancala board. Cereal bowls work well for this purpose.
The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on his side.
Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole (including your or your opponent's store) until the stones run out.
If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.
If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite. All captured pieces are placed in your store.
The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty.
The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends captures all of those pieces.
Count all the pieces in each store. The winner is the player with the most pieces.
